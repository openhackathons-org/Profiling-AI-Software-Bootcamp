# Optimizing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training program

This lab discusses profiling using NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems, focusing on steps to optimize a deep neural network (DNN) training program that detects handwritten digits using a PyTorch Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. The techniques and strategies discussed in this lab will translate to optimizing any application that uses NVIDIA's graphic processing units (GPUs).
